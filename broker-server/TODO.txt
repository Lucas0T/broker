Last contact does not work after restart
--
Last-contact information should be written to file/database on exit and reloaded on start.
Currently, this does not work properly: after a restart, last contact timestamps displayed 12 days in the past until the next connection is received.


Deleting requests does not delete all data
--
Add admin function to clean deleted requests with all associated data. 
Currently, some tables retain their information.
